Week 9 Weekend Challenge: To Do List App

## Description

This is a full-stack to do list app that allows users to create and track a list of tasks. Users are able to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, and the app will record the time of completion. 

## Installation & Usage

Fork and clone this repository. This app requires Node.js. If already installed, run "npm install" to install any dependencies.

PostgreSQL is also needed for this app. Once installed, connect to localhost on port 5432, and  import the database.sql file to get the database set up.

Run "npm start" into your console to start the app, and navigate to https://localhost:5000 in your browser to access the app.

The app will send new tasks to and pull tasks from the PostgreSQL database. New tasks can be added through the input box and the Add Task button. Tasks can be deleted using the red X button on the far right. Tasks can be marked as complete using the checkbox in the far left column.
